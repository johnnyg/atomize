atomize - A simple python package for generating Atom feeds

This package provides a simple way to construct an Atom Syndicated Format feed.
One simply constructs a Feed(...) object, providing it information about
the feed update time, a unique identifer for the feed, its title, author,
and entries. There are simple object definitions for every construct in
the Atom 1.0 specification.
